Distributed Knowledge aims to fundamentally transform our approach to Large Language Models (LLMs) by unifying the entire internet into a single, federated model. Instead of relying on monolithic or proprietary systems, this approach leverages a decentralized network where each node independently contributes to a shared "collective context." This eliminates central control, fostering collective intelligence through distributed collaboration.

## Why Distributed Knowledge?

Traditional LLM systems face significant limitations, including outdated knowledge, high resource demands, privacy issues, and centralized ownership. Distributed Knowledge addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Collective Intelligence**: Aggregating insights across a distributed user network.
- **Real-time Knowledge**: Ensuring information stays current without constant retraining.
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Architecture: Protecting sensitive data while sharing common insights.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reducing computational overhead by distributing workloads.
- **Public Ownership**: Maintaining open, decentralized control rather than proprietary ownership.

## Key Features

- **Federated Architecture**: Decentralized by design, with no central control point
- **Hybrid Privacy Model**: Public when it matters, private when it counts
- **Dynamic Knowledge**: No more retraining, the model evolves with every interaction
- **Autonomous Operation**: Self-organizing systems that adapt and evolve
- **Open Ecosystem**: Not owned or controlled by any single entity

## Technical Capabilities

- **Privacy by Design**: Your data is not shared with the network without your consent
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Network peers are authenticated with encrypted messages
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Unlock access to your network's data in real-time
- **Unified Context**: Access to a network-wide contextual knowledge base
- **Ollama Compatible**: Connect and run your favorite Ollama models
- **MCP Compatible**: Fully compatible with regular MCP Hosts
