## A decentralized, network-aware LLM system for collaborative intelligence

Distributed Knowledge is an innovative approach to AI that turns the entire network into a unified LLM model. Rather than relying on a single monolithic model, this system creates a federated network where every node contributes to collective intelligence without central control.

## Why Distributed Knowledge?

Traditional LLM systems face limitations in terms of knowledge freshness, resource requirements, and privacy concerns. Distributed Knowledge addresses these challenges through:

- **Collective Intelligence**: Leverage the knowledge of an entire network of users
- **Real-time Knowledge**: Access up-to-date information without model retraining
- **Privacy-Preserving Architecture**: Keep sensitive data private while sharing common knowledge
- **Resource Efficiency**: Accomplish more with less computing power

## Key Features

- **Federated Architecture**: Decentralized by design, with no central control point
- **Hybrid Privacy Model**: Public when it matters, private when it counts
- **Dynamic Knowledge**: No more retraining, the model evolves with every interaction
- **Autonomous Operation**: Self-organizing systems that adapt and evolve
- **Open Ecosystem**: Not owned or controlled by any single entity

## Technical Capabilities

- **Privacy by Design**: Your data is not shared with the network without your consent
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Unlock access to your network's data in real-time
- **Unified Context**: Access to a network-wide contextual knowledge base
- **Ollama Compatible**: Connect and run your favorite Ollama models
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Network peers are authenticated with encrypted messages
- **MCP Compatible**: Fully compatible with regular MCP Hosts
