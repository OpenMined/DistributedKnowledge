# Running Your Own Network Server

If you want to host your own Distributed Knowledge network:

```bash
# Navigate to the websocket server directory
cd websocketserver

# Build the server
go build

# Run the server
sudo ./websocketserver
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:80` and  `https://localhost:443` by default.
