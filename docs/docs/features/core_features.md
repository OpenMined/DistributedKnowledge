# Core Features

Distributed Knowledge offers a range of powerful features that enable collaborative intelligence across a network of nodes. This document outlines the core features that make up the system.

## Federated Architecture

At the heart of Distributed Knowledge is its federated architecture:

- **Decentralized Design**: No central authority or control point
- **Peer-to-Peer Interactions**: Direct communication between network nodes
- **Network Resilience**: The system remains functional even when nodes drop out
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Capacity grows as new nodes join the network
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Collective capabilities exceed those of individual nodes

## Knowledge Sharing

Distributed Knowledge enables efficient sharing of information:

- **Query Broadcasting**: Send questions to multiple nodes simultaneously
- **Direct Messaging**: Target specific nodes with relevant expertise
- **Knowledge Aggregation**: Combine insights from multiple sources
- **Answer Summarization**: Consolidate multiple responses into coherent answers
- **Citation Tracking**: Maintain references to information sources

## Privacy-Preserving Intelligence

The system balances collaboration with privacy:

- **Hybrid Privacy Model**: Share public knowledge while protecting private information
- **Selective Sharing**: Control what information is accessible to other nodes
- **Approval System**: Review and approve incoming queries
- **Anonymized Responses**: Option to provide answers without revealing identity
- **Private Knowledge Bases**: Maintain local information that isn't shared

## Real-time Synchronization

Information flows through the network in real-time:

- **Persistent WebSocket Connections**: Maintain live connections between nodes
- **Immediate Updates**: Receive responses as soon as they're available
- **Concurrent Processing**: Handle multiple queries and responses simultaneously
- **Live User Status**: Track which nodes are currently active
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: React to network changes immediately

## Multi-Provider LLM Support

The system works with various LLM providers:

- **Anthropic Integration**: Connect to Claude models
- **OpenAI Support**: Use GPT models for generation
- **Ollama Compatibility**: Run local open-source models
- **Provider Abstraction**: Switch between providers without changing application code
- **Model Configuration**: Customize parameters for each provider

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Enhanced responses through contextual retrieval:

- **Vector Database**: Store and retrieve semantic embeddings
- **Document Processing**: Convert various formats into useful knowledge chunks
- **Semantic Search**: Find information based on meaning rather than keywords
- **Context Windows**: Provide LLMs with the most relevant information
- **Source Tracking**: Maintain provenance for all retrieved information

## MCP Server Integration

The system integrates with the Model Context Protocol:

- **Tool Exposure**: Access network capabilities through standardized tools
- **Query Management**: Create, track, and manage questions
- **Answer Processing**: Review, edit, and summarize responses
- **User Management**: Interact with network participants
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Update and maintain information sources

## Secure Communication

All interactions are protected through comprehensive security measures:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted between sender and receiver
- **Identity Verification**: Cryptographic confirmation of node identities
- **Message Signing**: Digital signatures ensure content integrity
- **Access Control**: Permissions restrict actions to authorized users
- **Secure Connections**: TLS/SSL encryption for all network traffic

## Autonomous Operation

The system is designed for minimal human intervention:

- **Automatic Approval**: Rules determine which queries are automatically accepted
- **Self-Organization**: The network adapts to changing conditions
- **Independent Nodes**: Each node operates according to its own configuration
- **Resilient Connections**: Automatic reconnection after network disruptions
- **Persistent State**: Maintains operation across restarts

## Open Ecosystem

Distributed Knowledge embraces openness and interoperability:

- **Open Source**: Core components available under permissive licenses
- **Standardized Protocols**: Well-defined interfaces for integration
- **Extensible Design**: Framework for adding new capabilities
- **Community Governance**: Transparent development and decision-making
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works across different operating systems
