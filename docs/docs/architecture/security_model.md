# Security Model

Distributed Knowledge implements a comprehensive security model to ensure the integrity, privacy, and authenticity of all interactions within the network. This document outlines the security principles and mechanisms employed by the system.

## Core Security Principles

The security model of Distributed Knowledge is built on several key principles:

1. **End-to-End Encryption**: All communications are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access
2. **Identity Verification**: Cryptographic methods confirm the identity of network participants
3. **Data Privacy**: Users maintain control over what information they share
4. **Message Integrity**: Cryptographic signatures guarantee messages cannot be altered
5. **Access Control**: Permissions systems restrict who can perform sensitive operations

## Authentication System

### Public/Private Key Infrastructure

The system uses asymmetric cryptography (Ed25519) for identity verification:

- **Key Generation**: Each node generates a unique Ed25519 key pair
- **Public Key Distribution**: Public keys are shared with the network for verification
- **Private Key Security**: Private keys never leave the local system
- **Key Rotation**: Support for regular key updates to enhance security

### User Identity

Each user in the network is identified by:

- A unique user ID (e.g., "alice", "research_team")
- Their public key, which serves as a cryptographic identity
- Optional profile information for human-readable identification

## Message Security

### Digital Signatures

All messages in the system are digitally signed:

- The sender creates a hash of the message content
- The hash is encrypted with the sender's private key to create a signature
- Recipients verify the signature using the sender's public key
- This proves the message's authenticity and integrity

### Encryption

Sensitive messages use end-to-end encryption:

- Messages are encrypted with the recipient's public key
- Only the intended recipient can decrypt using their private key
- This ensures confidentiality even if the server is compromised

## Network Security

### TLS/SSL

All WebSocket connections use TLS/SSL encryption:

- Server authentication via certificates
- Encrypted data transport
- Protection against eavesdropping and tampering

### Connection Verification

The system employs additional verification steps:

- Certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- Secure key exchange protocols
- Connection integrity monitoring

## Privacy Controls

### Selective Sharing

Users control what information they share:

- Questions can be directed to specific peers rather than broadcasted
- Local knowledge bases can include private and shared sections
- Automatic rules determine what information is shared with whom

### Data Minimization

The system follows data minimization principles:

- Only necessary information is transmitted
- Metadata is limited to reduce fingerprinting
- Historical data is pruned according to retention policies

## Approval System

### Query Approval

Incoming queries go through an approval process:

- **Automatic Approval**: Rules define what queries are automatically accepted
- **Manual Review**: Queries that don't meet automatic criteria require user approval
- **Rejection**: Unwanted queries can be explicitly rejected

### Response Validation

Responses are validated for:

- Compliance with content policies
- Factual accuracy (when possible)
- Quality standards

## Implementation Details

### Key Management

Keys are managed securely:

```go
// Generate new Ed25519 key pair
publicKey, privateKey, err := ed25519.GenerateKey(rand.Reader)

// Save private key (typically done once during setup)
privateKeyBytes, err := x509.MarshalPKCS8PrivateKey(privateKey)
err = os.WriteFile("private.pem", privateKeyBytes, 0600)

// Extract public key
publicKeyBytes, err := x509.MarshalPKIXPublicKey(publicKey)
```

### Message Signing

Messages are signed before transmission:

```go
// Create message hash
hash := sha256.Sum256([]byte(message))

// Sign with private key
signature := ed25519.Sign(privateKey, hash[:])
// The signature is sent alongside the message
```

### Signature Verification

Recipients verify signatures upon receipt:

```go
// Verify signature using sender's public key
valid := ed25519.Verify(senderPublicKey, []byte(receivedMessage), receivedSignature)
if !valid {
    // Signature verification failed
}
```

## Security Best Practices

When working with Distributed Knowledge:

1. **Protect Private Keys**: Store private keys securely, never share them
2. **Verify Signatures**: Always check message signatures before trusting content
3. **Review Automatic Rules**: Regularly audit automatic approval conditions
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep the software updated with the latest security patches
5. **Monitor Connections**: Watch for unusual connection patterns or requests

## Security Limitations

While the system is designed to be secure, users should be aware of certain limitations:

- The system cannot protect against compromised endpoints
- Social engineering may bypass some security measures
- Metadata analysis could potentially reveal communication patterns
- Side-channel attacks remain a theoretical concern
