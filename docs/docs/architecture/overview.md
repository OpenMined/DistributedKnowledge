# Architecture Overview

Distributed Knowledge is built on a federated architecture that enables collective intelligence through secure, real-time communication between nodes. This document provides an overview of the system's architecture and how its components work together.

## Core Architecture

The Distributed Knowledge architecture consists of the following key components:

### 1. WebSocket Communication Layer

The foundation of Distributed Knowledge is its real-time communication system:

- **Secure WebSocket Protocol**: Provides encrypted, bidirectional communication
- **Authentication System**: Verifies identities through public/private key pairs
- **Message Routing**: Handles direct and broadcast message delivery
- **Active User Tracking**: Maintains a registry of online participants

### 2. Knowledge Management Layer

The system's ability to manage and retrieve information:

- **Vector Database**: Stores and retrieves embeddings for RAG functionality
- **Document Processing**: Converts raw documents into useful knowledge chunks
- **Knowledge Synchronization**: Maintains consistency across the network
- **Privacy Controls**: Ensures data is shared according to user preferences

### 3. LLM Integration Layer

The intelligence layer that processes queries and generates responses:

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Ollama
- **Context Management**: Prepares relevant context for LLM prompts
- **Response Generation**: Produces answers based on available knowledge
- **Answer Validation**: Ensures responses meet quality and accuracy standards

### 4. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server

The interface that allows other systems to interact with Distributed Knowledge:

- **Tool Integration**: Exposes DK capabilities as tools
- **Query/Response Flow**: Manages the lifecycle of questions and answers
- **User Management**: Handles user interactions and permissions
- **Automatic Approval System**: Filters responses based on defined criteria

## Data Flow

1. **Query Submission**:
   - A user submits a question via MCP tool or direct message
   - The query is routed to appropriate nodes based on addressing

2. **Knowledge Retrieval**:
   - The system searches the vector database for relevant documents
   - Matching information is retrieved and prepared as context

3. **Response Generation**:
   - The query and retrieved context are sent to the configured LLM
   - The LLM generates a response based on the provided information

4. **Approval Process**:
   - Generated responses are checked against automatic approval criteria
   - Responses either proceed directly or await manual approval

5. **Answer Delivery**:
   - Approved answers are delivered to the requesting user
   - Responses are stored for future reference and evaluation

## Security Model

Distributed Knowledge employs several security measures:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages are encrypted in transit
- **Identity Verification**: Public key cryptography confirms node identities
- **Permission System**: Controls who can query specific nodes
- **Privacy Controls**: Allows users to define what information is shared
- **Cryptographic Signatures**: Ensures message integrity and authenticity

## Federated Architecture Benefits

The federated nature of Distributed Knowledge offers several advantages:

- **No Single Point of Failure**: The network remains operational even if some nodes go offline
- **Distributed Processing**: Workload is spread across multiple nodes
- **Knowledge Specialization**: Nodes can focus on specific domains of expertise
- **Progressive Enhancement**: The network becomes more capable as nodes join
- **Resilience**: The system can adapt to changing conditions and requirements
